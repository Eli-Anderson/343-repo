# Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life simulation can be played [here](http://eli-anderson.github.io/343-repo/gol_gui/index.html). The game is created in pure Javascript (ES6), using my homemade prototyping engine found [here](https://github.com/Eli-Anderson/JSEngine2D)

# Othello

The classic game "Othello", also known as "Reversi" can be played [here](http://eli-anderson.github.io/343-repo/othello_gui/index.html). Similarly to Game of Life, it is pure ES6 and uses the engine found above.
